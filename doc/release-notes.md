How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the
installer (on Windows) or just copy over `/Applications/Pulsar-Qt` (on Mac)
or `pulsard`/`pulsar-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run any version of the wallet, your chainstate database will 
need to be synced, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour, 
depending on the speed of your machine and the quality of your network connection.

Downgrading warning
-------------------

Wallet versions below 1.1.2 are no longer supported and will not sync properly if you 
are not able to modify configuration files on your own. Please update to the latest 
release version to improve network connectivity.

Compatibility
==============

PulsarCoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

PulsarCoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.
